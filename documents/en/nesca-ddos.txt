NESCA4 supports DDOS via the TCP and ICMP protocols.

1. Usage:
    -icmp-ddos       Flag that is used to enable ICMP ddos.
    -tcp-ddos        Flag that is used to enable TCP ddos.

    -ddos-len <num>  Flag that is used to specify the number of packets, their number is specified in its arguments.
    -TDD <num>       Flag that is used to specify the maximum number of threads (packets at a time),
                     the number is passed in its arguments.

  But this is not enough to load the host, you need to increase the packet size.

    -data-len <num>  Flag that allows to fill the packet with random characters,
                the number of these characters is specified in its arguments.

  Here is an example of a command for ICMP DDOS:
    sudo ./nesca4 google.com -icmp-ddos -ddos-len 10000 -data-len 1400

  Example for TCP DDOS:
    sudo ./nesca4 google.com -tcp-ddos -ddos-len 10000 -data-len 1400 -p 80

2. Features:
  Specifying -data-len greater than 1400 is not recommended, the system starts rejecting packets.
  If you specify multiple DDOS targets, NESCA4 will load them all, first sending the specified number
  of packets to the first host, then to the second, and so on.

  It is also worth saying that TCP DDOS will take into account the first specified port, let's say you
  specified -p 80,443,21. DDOS will be exactly on port 80.

  Also almost all other arguments for port scan, like -frag, or -ack, or -scanflags are supported for DDOS as well.

3. Default values:
  * By standard, -ddos-len is worth 5000 packets.
  * By standard -TDD stands at 500 threads.
  * By standard -data-len is set to 0, it is disabled.
