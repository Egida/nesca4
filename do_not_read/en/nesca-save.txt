    -html <path>     This flag allow you to enable saving scan results to html, the arguments specify
                     the path to the file (file name) where you want to save the results.

    -json <path>     This flag allow you to enable saving scan results to json, the arguments specify
                     the path to the file (file name) where you want to save the results.

  Example of saving to html:
    sudo ./nesca4 google.com,yandex.ru -html output.html

  Example of saving to json:

2. Features:
  Please note that you need to specify the file name along with the format, as in the examples.

  In html the bruteforce results will look like in the terminal output, that is:
    admin:12345@192.168.1.35:80

  * Login is : admin
  * Pass is  : 12345
  * Ip is    : 192.168.1.35

  You can throw the results of saving to JSON into nesca-viewer for viewing.
